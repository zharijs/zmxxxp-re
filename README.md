# Community announcment
As many of you are swapping out Zortrax HW with BTT and alike, I guess you have OG boards you don't need. 

DM me - I could make some use of those for the greater good

# What?
Zortrax m200, m300 series reverse engineering to port Klipper.

# Why?
Becuase Zortrax support is non existant and functionality is outdated and was somewhat limited even back wehn it was a new product.

# Where?

## Wiring maps
Sketch wiring maps, compare wiring, boards:
- [ ] M200
- [ ] M300
- [ ] M200 plus
- [x] M300 plus
- [ ] M300 dual

## Schematics

## MCU pinout
- [ ] M200
- [ ] M300
- [ ] M200 plus
- [x] M300 plus
- [ ] M300 dual

## Port Klipper
- [ ] Start porting it, see what issues come up

## Android board
Evaluate options:
1. It runs on Allwinner A33 - Linux support is somewaht lacking
2. Is bootloader locked / eMMC encrypted?
3. Custom Android instead of linux if possible?
4. Just make a a SOM board with Raspberry Compute, Digi or Variscite SoM to fit same mount and talk to same display and touch?

- [ ] Research the CPU support
- [ ] Evaluate feasability

## Extra mods / changes
- [ ] Add vibration sensor for input shaping
- [ ] Replace ribbon with wire harness and drag chain
- [ ] Bigger motors for 300 series
- [ ] Use native Ethernet, if Android board is changed to somehting else
- [ ] Add magnetic layer to heatplate to use with flexible paltes
- [ ] Add load cells to scan level precisely and without electrical contact (worst design chopice of all M series)
